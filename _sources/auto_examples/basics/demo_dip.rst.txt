Reconstructing an image using the deep image prior.
===================================================

This code shows how to reconstruct a noisy and incomplete image using the deep image prior.

This method is based on the paper `"Deep Image Prior" by Ulyanov et al. (2018)
<https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10925>`_, and reconstructs
an image by minimizing the loss function

.. math::

    \min_{\theta}  \|y-Af_{\theta}(z)\|^2

where :math:`z` is a random input and :math:`f_{\theta}` is a convolutional decoder network with parameters
:math:`\theta`. The minimization should be stopped early to avoid overfitting. The method uses the Adam
optimizer.

Define forward operator and noise model
---------------------------------------

We use image inpainting as the forward operator and Gaussian noise as the noise model.

    sigma = 0.1  # noise level
    physics = dinv.physics.Inpainting(mask=0.5, img_size=x.shape[1:], device=device)

Generate the measurement

We apply the forward model to generate the noisy measurement.

Define the deep image prior
----------------------------

This method only works with certain convolutional decoder networks. We recommend using the
network :class:`deepinv.models.ConvDecoder`.

.. note::

    The number of iterations and learning rate have been set manually to obtain good results. However, these
    values may not be optimal for all problems. We recommend experimenting with different values.

.. note::

    Here we run a small number of iterations to reduce the runtime of the example. However, the results could
    be improved by running more iterations.

Run DIP algorithm and plot results
----------------------------------
We run the DIP algorithm and plot the results.

The good performance of DIP is somewhat surprising, since the network has many parameters and could potentially
overfit the noisy measurement data. However, the architecture acts as an implicit regularizer, providing good
reconstructions if the optimization is stopped early.
While this phenomenon is not yet well understood, there has been some efforts to explain it. For example, see
`"The Neural Tangent Link Between CNN Denoisers and Non-Local Filters"
<https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/html/Tachella_The_Neural_Tangent_Link_Between_CNN_Denoisers_and_Non-Local_Filters_CVPR_2021_paper.html>`_.
